# Spaco Standards Recommendations(draft)

The Spaco Interoperability Group (The Spaco IG) aims to advance the Spaco ecosystem and promote good standards by bringing together projects and people to collaborate. It develops and publicises standards by real-world experience as well as researchs and experimentations by itself and others, to form Spaco Standard Recommendations (SSRs).


## Member Projects

The Spaco IG member projects are known, publicly available Spaco projects, significant holders and organizations that have shown an interest in supporting the Spaco IG’s mission and work.  Member Projects are required to implement any particular SSR and expected to give relevant SSRs due consideration.

Projects may leverage code, libraries, or frameworks from other projects without being disqualified. In cases where that distinction is unclear that Project Representatives should use their best judgment to implement the spirit of this clause.


## The Core Committee

The Core Committee is a twelve (12) member board of individuals recognized for their technical skill and expertise. The Core Committee is responsible for final decisions regarding what specifications Spaco IG will consider and those that are approved. The Core Committee is responsible for ensuring a high level of quality and consistency amongst all published specifications, and that all relevant perspectives and use cases are given due consideration.

Core Committee members are not permitted to also be a Secretary. A Project Representative is permitted but not required to also serve as a member of the Core Committee, however, Core Committee members are expected to consider the impact of their actions on the Spaco ecosystem as a whole when acting in their capacity as a Core Committee member

Core Committee members are expected to take an active interest in all topics brought before Spaco IG.

## Spaco Enginerring Groups(SEG)

Spaco Enginerring Groups are principally responsible for the development of the content of SSR. Members of a Spaco Enginerring Group are expected to be actively engaged in the development of a SSR and in discussions relating to it.

Members of the general public may apply to join the Spaco Enginerring Group at any time, subject to the approval of the Editor or Sponsor if, in their judgment, the applicant’s experience and perspective would be particularly valuable to the development of the specification. Project Representatives or a proxy they specify may apply to join the Spaco Enginerring Group at any time, unless objected to by the Editor or Sponsor if, in their judgement, the applicant has little value to offer the process and/or would be disruptive to the smooth functioning of the Spaco Enginerring Group.

A Spaco Enginerring Group member may be removed at any time by the Editor and Sponsor if, in their judgement, the individual has become inactive for more than 180 days or if the individual is disruptive to the smooth functioning of the Spaco Enginerring Group.


## Editor

The Editor of a SSR is an individual who is actively involved in managing and tracking a SSR as it is written. The Editor is responsible for managing the development of a SSR; for representing the SSR in discussions with the rest of the Spaco IG; for coordinating other contributors; and for working with the Sponsor to see the SSR through the review process. Any individual may be an Editor. If the Editor of a proposal is missing for more than 45 days without notice then the Sponsor and Core Committee may agree upon a new Editor. The Editor is the final authority on the content of a SSR while it is in Draft.


## Sponsor

A SSR must be sponsored by a member of the Core Committee. That individual is the Sponsor. The Sponsor may not also be the Editor. One person may be the sponsor on multiple SSRs and they provide a level of oversight on the SSR’s drafting on behalf of the Core Committee, and representation of the SSR Enginerring Group to the Core Committee. Multiple other Core Committee members may also be on the Spaco Enginerring Group if they wish.
